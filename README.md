# Introduction

Add your Paper Notes as markdown files, which should have a header like such format:

```markdown
---
title: Paper's Title
mathjax: true
author: Your name
date: 2019-10-11 19:44:05
categories:
- Paper
---
```

Pay attention that if you have used latex mathjax additions, the mathjax above must set to True.
